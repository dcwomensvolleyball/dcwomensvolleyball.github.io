        <li style="margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;"><i>Three games</i> - First two sets are to 21, third set is to 15. There is a cap of 25 for the first two sets. Cap is 17 for the third set. If we're running out of time, to "win" the third set, you must have at least 7 points. If fewer points are scored, the third set is considered a tie.</li>

      <div class="content">
        <li style="margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;"><i>Call your own</i> - We don't have refs, but highly encourage a 'call your own' doubles, foot faults, back row attack, and net violations mentality. If we all are vigilant about calling things on our own team, then we don't need to call them across the net. If there is a call that is up for debate, please feel free to call a replay.</li>

      <button class="collapsible" onclick="collapseTab()">Substitutions</button>
      <div class="content">
        <li style="margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">If a team has <i>MORE</i> than 3 non-roster subs, they would start down by 5 points (or rather, the opposing team would be given 5 additional points to start). For playoffs, substitutions must be approved by opposing team captain. Overall, regardless of playoffs, please try to substitute like for like in terms of skill level.</li>

      <div class="content">
        <li style="margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">The gym is great and sets up the nets for us... but unfortunately they don't always set it to the correct height. If you get there early, please please please help with adjusting it.</li>

      <div class="content">
        <li style="margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">The earliest they will let us into the gym is <b>6:50pm</b>. I encourage everyone to take advantage of that if you have the early game for warm-up time to ensure we start on time and get out on time.</li>
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible" onclick="collapseTab()">Departure time</button>
      <div class="content">
