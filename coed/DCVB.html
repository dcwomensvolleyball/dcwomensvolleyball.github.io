    <div id="Rules" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;margin-left:15px;margin-top:15px;margin-right:15px;">
      <p>This is a self-run league. We rely on captains to enforce and ensure all team members are aware of our league policies and rules on the court.</p>
      <ul class="rules" style="margin-left:25px;">
        <li><b>Self-regulated:</b> Teams should be judicious in calling their own violations.</li>
        <li><b>Women:</b> There must be three women on the court at all times. One can be a libero and allowed to serve in one rotation. Three women on the court rule is suspended when the opposite of the libero is serving. No girl touch rule applies.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If your team is short of three women, it's okay to start with just two women as long as you have no more than three guys on the court. So three guys and two women or three guys and one woman; no ghost rule applies.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Points:</b> Cap is 27 points.</li>
        <li><b>Time:</b> Match #1 ends at 8:00pm SHARP and Match #2 ends at 9:00pm SHARP.
          <ul>
            <li>When possible, we will give you a warning that your match needs to wrap up/call “last point” at 7:59pm and 8:59pm. This is out of courtesy to you, but ultimately it is on each team to be aware of the time and end promptly at 8 and 9.</li>
            <li>If you hit time and the 3rd game is tied, each team gets 0.25 point for that third game.</li>
            <li>There is a hard start time of 7:10pm and 8:10pm.
              <ul>
                <li>If at start time (7:10 or 8:10) all of your players have not arrived, you can either find a sub that just happens to be at the gym or start short.</li>
                <li>If you deliberately choose to start late despite someone calling for the match to begin, you risk forfeiting points for any games not played.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Subbing in Playoffs:</b> Subs should be of equivalent skill level and must be run past the opposing team's captain prior to the match. If there are disagreements on if a sub is of equivalent skill level, the dispute should be brought to a steering committee member.
        <li><b>Continuation of Play:</b> The pursuit rule is permitted. Depending on the object interfering, there are different rules for if continuation is allowed.
          <ul>
            <li>Basketball hoops and their extensions (back and side hoops) - includes the connector (the black beams), backboard, etc.:
              <ul>
                <li>When the hoops are up, they are fair game and considered in-bounds to play off of.</li>
                <li>When the hoops are down, the ball is considered dead upon contact unless it interfered with the play and a player was there/could have realistically gotten to the ball had the hoop not interfered.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Walls, court dividers (the cloth "walls"), and track outline (the bars that run along the "second floor" of the gym):
              <ul>
                <li>Ball is considered dead upon contact.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ropes (Court 2)
              <ul>
                <li>When the ropes are hanging over the court and a ball hits them during play, it is considered an automatic replay.</li> 
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Playoffs:</b> Standings are calculated by:
          <ol>
            <li>Set Points</li>
            <li>Head-to-Head</li>
            <li>Greater # of 2.5 Set Point Wins</li>
            <li>Coin Flip</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
